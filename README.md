# Minicourse Deep Learning

 THe bias and variance tradeoff are defined and introduces de basic concepts for Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks.
This notebook has some suggestions of projects to practice.

## Experiences

- Minicourse on Deep Learning for CV (18/05/2018)

  Presented by Vitor, Vinicius and Artur. The Minicourse on Introduction to Computer Vision
  aims to present
  the field of Computer Vision focusing on neural techniques for classification. Subjects
  range from Digital Image Processing with OpenCV
  to Convolutional Neural Networks. The fourth part (of five) of it is this minicourse on MLPs.
